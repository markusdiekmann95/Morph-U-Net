# Morph-U-Net
Application of the MorphNet Approach on the U-Net

This is an own PyTorch-based implementation of the MorphNet Approach to apply [MorphNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06798) on the U-Net.
The data set used for this study, is the [Inria Aerial Image Labeling](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/).
